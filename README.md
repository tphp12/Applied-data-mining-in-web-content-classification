# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry. I used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and machine learning modeling. Through this project, I gained insights into customer behavior and key factors influencing churn.
## Problem Statement
- Analyzing the Telecom Customer Churn dataset helps telecommunications companies analyze customer behavior and identify reasons for customer churn.
- With 7,043 customers from a telecommunications company in California, this dataset provides information on customer profiles, services used, and current customer status, helping businesses come up with optimal strategies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset and its details are provided in telecom_data_dictionary.csv.

## The questions about this dataset
1. What is the churn rate?
2. Which customer groups have the highest churn rates based on contract type?
3. What are the main reasons for churn?
4 .What are the most important factors in predicting churn?
5. Predicting whether a customer will churn or not.
## Steps Taken
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Selection & Engineering
5. Model Building & Evaluation 
## Results & Limitations
- Identified key factors influencing customer churn, such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
- The model achieved a reasonable performance in predicting churn.
- Limitation: The dataset is limited in size, which may affect model generalizability.
